This is how it works:
1. The save.js file grabs the list of courses from the learning suite home page and sends it to a background page running eventPage.js.
2. eventPage.js saves the list using the chrome.storage api.
3. load.js is added to every page.  On each pageload it requests the list from the eventPage and then adds it to the drop-down part of the DOM.

tl; dr: It does a copy-paste of your course list.
